  <p>Mutations IMpact on Phsophorylation (MIMP) is a web service that predicts if a mutation within a phosphorylation site will alter phosphorylation. MIMP works by constructing specificity models for kinases, which are then used to score phosphosites containing a mutation before and after the mutation to predict the impact it may have on phosphorylation.</p>
