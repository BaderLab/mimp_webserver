  <h4>What is MIMP?</h4>
  <div id="1">
    <p>Mutations IMpact on Phosphorylation (MIMP) is a web service that predicts if a mutation within a phosphorylation site will alter phosphorylation. MIMP works by constructing specificity models for kinases, which are then used to score phosphosites containing a mutation before and after the mutation to predict the impact it may have on phosphorylation. There are three types of events that can occur</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Loss-of-binding: the mutation disrupts specificity for a kinase</li>
    <li>Gain-of-binding: the mutation creates a new motif which causes phosphorylation by a new kinase</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>How do I use it?</h4>
  <div id="2">
    <p>To use MIMP you will need two mandatory files and one optional file. </p>
    
    <ol>
    	<li>FASTA file of protein sequences. For example: 
    		<pre>>seq0
FQTWEEFSRAAEKLYLADPMKVRVVLKYRHVDGNLCIKVTDDLVCLVYRTDQAQDVKKIEKF
>seq1
KYRTWEEFTRAAEKLYQADPMKVRVVLKYRHCDGNLCIKVTDDVVCLLYRTDQAQDVKKIEKFHSQLMRLME LKVTDNKECLKFKTDQAQEAKKMEKLNNIFFTLM</pre>
    		<p><em>Note:</em> Avoid using spaces in your fasta headers. If spaces are used, MIMP will use the text before the first space as the header. For example, <code>>seq more text</code> will become <code>>seq</code>. If you do use spaces in your headers, make sure your mutation and phosphorylation data correspond to the equivalent of <code>>seq</code> in this case.</p>
    	</li>
    	<li>Mutation data. This should contain the name of the protein and the mutation, space delimited. The mutation should have a <code>X123Z</code> format, where <code>X</code> is the reference amino acid, <code>Z</code> is the alternate amino acid and <code>123</code> is the position of the substitution. Protein names should correspond to that of the fasta file. For example:
    	<pre>seq0 F1H
seq1 T4V
seq1 W5L</pre>
    	
    	</li>
    	<li>Phosphorylation site data <b>(optional but recommended)</b>. This should contain the name of the protein and the position of phosphoacceptor S, T or Y residue, space delimited. Protein names should correspond to that of the fasta file. For example:
    	<pre>seq0 8
seq0 15
seq1 9</pre>
		All positions must correspond to an S, T or Y residue. If you are not providing phosphorylation site data, MIMP will consider each S, T or Y residue as a potential phosphoacceptor.
    	</li>
    <ol>
  </div>

  <h4>What are the &alpha; and &beta; cutoffs?</h4>
  <p>Once a score is obtained for both the wildtype and mutant phosphosite, MIMP will use kinase specificity models to score phosphosites that belong to a kinase (positive) and that do not (negative). This results in two distributions being generated: foreground and background. &alpha; and &beta; represent percentiles of the foreground and background distributions, respectively. In order for a loss-of-signalling event to occur, the score of the wildtype phosphosite must be greater than the score at the &alpha; percentile and the score of the mutant phosphosite must be less than the score at the &beta; percentile. This is vice versa for gain-of-signalling.
  </p>
  <p>

  By default, &beta; is the 90th percentile and &alpha; is 10th percentile:

  <h4>What are the different kinase specificity models?</h4>
  <p>There are three different sets of specificity models. The chosen set is used in the scanning of phosphorylation rewiring in MIMP. </p>
  <ol>
	<li><b>Individual kinase specificity models</b> these are specificity models constructed using experimentally verified kinase-peptide phosphorylation on an individual kinase level. Data is obtained from public databases such as PhosphoSitePlus, PhosphoELM and HPRD. Since these models are constructed using experimental data on the peptide level, they are considered high confidence.</li>
	<li><b>Kinase family specificity models</b> This is similar to 1. Since kinase families typically have similar specificities, these models are also constructed using experimentally verified kinase-peptide phosphorylation, but are grouped based on the kinase families/subfamilies. This can have certain advantages and disadvantages. For example, there are cases where members of kinase families show a moderate and sometimes large difference from that of the collapsed family model. However, using kinase family models can avoid redundant (gain or loss of phosphorylation) prediction of family members that have similar specificities.</li>
	<li><b>Predicted individual kinase specificity models</b> these are specificity models that are predicted from kinase-substrate interactions, on the protein level and not the peptide. The kinase-substrate relationships (KSRs) are derived using protein microarrays as described in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23549483" target="_blank">Newman <em>et al.</em> (2013)</a>. The KSRs are then combined with experimentally identified phosphosites to predict the specificity models by through an iterative refinement process (termed M3) similar to that described in the MIMP paper. For more information on the M3 algorithm please see the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23549483" target="_blank">Newman <em>et al.</em> (2013)</a> paper.
	<br>
	<p class="warning-link">Please be extremely cautious when using these models. While KSRs are identified <em>in vitro</em> and some models may be correct, it is likely that others are not. These models are thus considered low-confidence. </p>

  </ol>

  <h4>What do the scores mean?</h4>
  <p>The scores quantitatively represent how well a phosphosite is likely to be phosphorylated by a kinase. Scores range from 0-1, where 0 represents no predicted phosphorylation and 1 represents perfect phosphorylation. 
  <br>If a peptide has a score of -1, this means it cannot be assigned a score because the central residue has been mutated to or from a non STY residue and a kinase will never phosphorylate it. For example, <code>HAWNKDR<u>T</u>QIAICPN</code> will have a score between 0-1, while <code>HAWNKDR<u>A</u>QIAICPN</code> will have a score of -1.</p>

  <hr>
  
  <h4>What does the log ratio mean?</h4>
  <p>The log ratio measures how distant the wildtype score is from the mutant, which we use as a measure of how confident we are of an event occurring. A high positive log ratio represents a high confidence gain-of-signaling event. A high negative log ratio represents a high confidence loss-of-signaling event. We consider the following confidence intervals for the absolute value of the log ratio:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Low confidence: 0-1</li>
  <li>Medium confidence 1-2</li>
  <li>High confidence: 2 or greater</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Note:</em> If the log ratio has a value of <code>-</code>, this means a log ratio cannot be assigned due to the fact that one of the scores has a value of -1. You can assume this log ratio is of high confidence <em>i.e.</em> approaches infinity (for gains) or -infinity (for losses)</p>
